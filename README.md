## Description

This project is a simple program to organize all the information about your team that you would need in a pinch.  The focus of this project was to work on my skills with Object Orientated Programming (OOP).  I faced a lot of confusing moments working on this project, but it really helped me to understand how useful thinking this way is.  Also, I was once again reminded that you really have to check every single line if your code isn't working.
